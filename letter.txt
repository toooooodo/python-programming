High dynamic range (HDR) imaging from a set of sequential exposures is an easy way to capture high-quality images of static scenes, but suffers from artifacts for scenes with significant motion. 
In this paper, we propose a new approach to HDR reconstruction that draws information from all the exposures but is more robust to camera/scene motion than previous techniques. Our algorithm is based on a novel patch-based energy-minimization formulation that integrates alignment and reconstruction in a joint optimization through an equation we call the HDR image synthesis equation. This allows us to produce an HDR result that is aligned to one of the exposures yet contains information from all of them. We present results that show considerable improvement over previous approaches.
